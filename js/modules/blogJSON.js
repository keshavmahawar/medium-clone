                "Love or hate The Last Jedi, you can’t deny that at least Rian Johnson tried something different. You may disagree with some of his decisions (I certainly do), but after The Force Awakens, it was absolutely necessary to shake up the formula in the second stanza; otherwise the new movies would only be a pale shadow of the original trilogy, mimicry playing to nostalgia.\n\nThe Last Jedi delivered an “I am your father” moment by summarily dispensing with the mysterious Snoke and briefly uniting Kylo and Rey in a furious throne room fight. You may decry Snoke’s exit as unnecessarily abrupt, but to me he was never more than a clumsy caricature of the Emperor.\n\nKilling Snoke in what amounts to the appetizer course was a palate cleanser. Even in spite of The Last Jedi’s faults, I walked out of the theater thrumming with possibility. It seemed as though the story could go anywhere. Imagine a conclusion in which Kylo Ren filled the role of both Darth Vader and the Emperor.",

                "Only for a handful of times in our lives we’ll be in the presence of a cultural event of resounding importance. In 28 years, I have already witnessed a few milestones of film history. When it comes to massive attendance to experience a film, I can think of titles like Titanic, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Harry Potter series, and, of course, the long-awaited return of the Star Wars franchise -which I’ve experienced twice: first with Lucas’ Prequel trilogy, and more recently with the Disney-Lucasfilm era.\n\nAvengers: Endgame joins that list triumphantly. As the emotional cap off to more than 20 movies and 10+ years of content, it’s a transcendent cultural affair that, quite honestly, will probably be impossible to replicate.\n\nSimply put, Endgame is colossal. So many emotions, moments, characters, twists, jokes, and effects are part of it, that it simply shouldn’t work. But far from becoming an uneven pastiche, one way or another, Endgame delivers. But how?\n\nKeep in mind: I’m delving into spoilers from now on. You’ve been warned.",

                "I typically try to avoid reading or listening to other peoples opinions before I write my reviews but I knew it wouldn’t matter much with Endgame. My opinion was solidified the moment I left my seat in the movie theater.\n\nAvengers Endgame is the peak moviegoing experience of this generation. This is the culmination of a series so clandestine and forthcoming to provide shock, awe, and wonderment.\n\nThe MCU is so ubiquitous in pop culture, I’d be curious to hear the opinion of someone who only tuned in for the last two Avengers films. Is the material accessible for someone fresh to the series? I can’t speak on that, I’ve watched damn near all of them.\n\nBecause Marvel movies have plots and characters arcing and threading from movie to movie, it’s fairly crucial to have a grasp of who the main heroes are and what they represent not only as a superhero but an individual ego and personality. Marvel doesn’t play its characters loose or malleable, which is to their advantage, because the emotional investment is that much deeper.\n\nIt’s what puts Iron Man and Captain America as central stars to this loaded cast. Most Marvel heroes will get their moment in the sun, but Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans in their respective roles have shaped how superheroes are perceived and portrayed in cinema. In Downey’s case, he is arguably the gold standard for portraying a superhero in today’s boom era of the genre. He’s made a lot of people a hell of a lot of money.",

                "Empty streets. Memorial monoliths engraved with the names of “The Vanished.” A crippled team of Avengers having to come to terms with failure. The demolished keys to an unholy past. This is the melancholy state in which Thanos left Earth and, as Captain Marvel tells us, the whole Marvel universe in the earliest developments of Avengers: Endgame. Infinity War, in many aspects, pales in contrast to this grand climax to some of the most endearing characters who entertained us through the MCU’s first three phases. Here is an analysis of one of the highlights of the greatest adventure sagas produced in early 21st-century cinema.\n\nIs the film lengthy? Yes. But I’ve sat through the thrilling extended versions of all the Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit) movies. And I’ve forced myself through the mediocre, butt-numbing event which is Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar (2014). Trust me, Endgame is a breeze. It keeps you interested and provides one continual flow of adventure filled with anticipation.\nOverview of How Characters Got Used and Came to Fruition\n\nThe running time of individual shots and the emotion portrayed by many of the actors seems slightly superior to the previous film. This adds genuine depth to their characters. Endgame wholeheartedly makes up for the lack of character development and the mediocre use of certain characters that loomed over the story aesthetics of the prior Avengers movie.\n\nFor many of the Avengers, it provides better focus and individual character arcs. The close of some of their personal stories is bittersweet. Almost everyone walks away having resolved some regret or vice they have been struggling with in the prior movies. Thankfully, in regards to this, the movie nailed it! If it hadn’t, it would have provided a flat ending to part of a momentous saga.",

                "I’ve always felt this way, just that I’m more aware of it now, as if a slight cough suddenly developed into a full-blown disease. For years, I could easily avoid Star Wars, tuning out during conversations at school or work, skipping the new episodes, ignoring the endless books, graphic novels, comic books, toys, headline references, images, posters, T-shirts and other signs of cultural dominance. But now that my son is 7, I can’t escape it — the phenomenon surrounds me every day — and I’ve recognized how unique my condition is.\n\nWhen “Star Wars” was first released, of course I saw it. Like every other kid in America, I went with some friends to a movie theater in downtown Boston on the day it premiered in May 1977. We were in fourth grade, school was winding down and summer vacation beckoned. We’d all seen the trailer and the full-page ads featuring Luke Skywalker wielding that strange new weapon called a light saber. Even in that analog era, the hype machine was in full effect. And at that age, old enough to appreciate plot twists but still full of childish wonder, we were ready to fall under the spell of a fairy tale that promised to be so much more exciting than anything we’d read in comic books or seen in Saturday morning cartoons. As our parents dropped us off and we walked into the dark theater that day, we clutched huge bags of popcorn and savored the joy of anticipation.\n\nBut unlike every other kid in America, I wasn’t spellbound. I didn’t swoon. I didn’t go back to see it again the next day or the day after that or ever again. I didn’t buy a single Star Wars doll or toy or comic book. I may have seen “Empire Strikes Back” when it came out two years later, but I’m not even sure. Neither do I remember seeing “Return of the Jedi.” I know that at some point, I watched both of those movies — one of them includes the “Luke, I am your father” scene and the other one has Jabba the Hutt, right? But it might have been on TV or on video, for all I know. That’s how much of an impression they made on me.",
